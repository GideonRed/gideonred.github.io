Tired of killing Docker containers by having to type in
`docker rm <docker_container>`? With every dull stroke of keys on the keyboard,
you only wish that you could be saving earth from a possible invasion from
hell? No worries anymore! Now you can kill those Docker containers with the
proper tool, a rocket launcher (or BFG, or shotgun, or whatever)!
